# What That Say!

### A game where you have to guess what the words are in a "Death Metal Band" type of Font.

:metal: :metal: :metal:

-- Things that need to be completed:

- [ ] Write function to make sure words don't repeat too often.
- [ ] Check bug where plyaer guesses again and previously solved word shows as not correct.

## Issues

- [ ] Fix issue where some of the fonts "CronicleDemo" will overlap into the guess box area. Need to only get that one font smaller without it affecting the other fonts.

- Sometimes it says the answer is wrong, even though it should be a correct guess. See screenshot below:

- Issue only seems to happen on mobile but sometimes the font cuts off and another random font shows behind it. Doesn't affect the word combo but looks odd. Example screenshot from mobile below:
